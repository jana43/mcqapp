            "solution": " Solution:\t\tIn decimal systems, kilo stands for 1,000, but in binary systems, a kilo is 1,024 (2 to the 10th power). Technically, therefore, a kilobyte is 1,024 bytes, but it is often used loosely as a synonym for 1,000 bytes. For example, a computer that has 256K main memory can store approximately 256,000 bytes (or characters) in memory at one time.A megabyte is 2 to the 20th power (approximately 1 million) and a gigabytes 2 to the 30th power (approximately 1 billion).In computer literature, a kilobyte is usually abbreviated as K or KB. To distinguish between a decimal K (1,000) and a binary K (1,024), the IEEE has suggested following the convention of using a small k for a decimal kilo and a capital Kfor a binary kilo, but this convention is by no means strictly followed.

A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface. The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Originally wired to a computer, many modern mouse are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system. Mouse originally used a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, but modern mouse often have optical sensors that have no moving parts. In addition to moving a cursor, computer mouse have one or more buttons to allow operations such as selection of a menu item on a display. Mouse often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and \"wheels\", which enable additional control and dimensional input. ",

But later almost everything was done in an 8-bit system. With 7 bits, 128 numbers (0-127 in decimal notation) are available to code characters. A bit is a binary digit which can have either two values, on or off. Seven bits can have 2^7 or 128 possible unique values. ASCII was soon expanded to an 8-bit system that has 256 code points, 0-255 (8-bit corresponds to 2 ^ 8 ie. 256 possibilities). There are many variants of Extended ASCII characters (8-bit system) to cover regional characters and symbols. One example is the extended ASCII characters which includes various letters needed for writing languages of Western Europe and certain special characters. Source : wikipedia.org ",

It has been used by various academic, commercial and industrial organizations since it was introduced in the 1960s, and continues to be actively used. PL/I's main domains are data processing, numerical computation, scientific computing, and system programming; it supports recursion, structured programming, linked data structure handling, fixed-point, floating-point, complex, character string handling, and bit string handling. The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats, with a wide set of functions available to verify and manipulate them. ",

The computer industry has used the term \"central processing unit\" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.
