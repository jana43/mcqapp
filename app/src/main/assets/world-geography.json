Like all plants, seagrasses rely on sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into food/energy (via a process called photosynthesis). Therefore, they only succeed in clear, shallow waters. When the conditions are just right, seagrasses can densely cover the sea floor, creating an ecosystem known as the seagrass bed or seagrass meadow.
